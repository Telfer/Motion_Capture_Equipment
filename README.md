 Just some bits and bobs that were developed while working in and around motion capture labs for the past few years

## Marker skeleton

Mesh files: marker_holder.stl. 

After forgeting to put a marker on for the n-th time, I bought a cheap anatomical skeleton, printed these little marker holders, and started using this set up as a way both to store the markers (pre-taped) and show the landmarks where they need to go. We just put the skeleton next to the participant and transfer the markers over one at a time. Usually easy to see if one has been missed. If you use multiple marker sets you could potentially color code or something. 

Designed for ~18mm (3/4 inch) tape. I used short (~12mm) M3 or M4 screws to attach the marker holders to the bones, along with longer ones to hang the marker plates from. Depending on your skeleton, you may also need to make extra plates to attach between bones and stop it swinging around.

## Marker plates

Mesh files: marker_plate_120-72-11.stl, marker_plate_120-80-9.stl, and marker_plate_120-60-6.stl. 

These do the job and are a lot less expensive than the ones I've seen commericially. The stl files are the ones I use for shank, thigh, and upper arm. These seem to work well but can be easily scaled to generate custom sizes as well. Be sure to print flat on the build plate for optimal strength. Both PETG and PLA have worked for me.
